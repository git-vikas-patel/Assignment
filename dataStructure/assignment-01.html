        <h1>Pointer</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><p> A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable</p></li>
            <li> A pointer can also be used to refer to another pointer function.</li>
        </ul>
       <h1>Pointer in JAVA</h1>
       <ul>
           <li>Java doesn't support pointer explicitly</li>
           <li>But java uses pointer implicitly: Java use pointers for manipulations of references but these pointers are not available for outside use</li>
           <li>Any operations implicitly done by the language are actually NOT visible</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Java doesnâ€™t have pointers , Java has references.</h3>
        <p><strong>Reference : </strong>A reference is a variable that refers to something else and can be used as an alias for that something else.</p>
